# League of Legends Champion Database (Java)

A Java-based mini database component designed to efficiently store, retrieve, and manage structured data related to League of Legends champions.  
This project was implemented using **The Ohio State University Components Library**, strictly following OSU component design and implementation guidelines.

## Overview

This project defines a custom database-like component that manages information about League of Legends champions, including structured attributes and associated metadata. The component is designed with a strong emphasis on abstraction, correctness, and adherence to formal specifications.

The implementation prioritizes:
- Clear separation between interface and implementation
- Data structure invariants
- Robust testing and documentation

## Key Features

- Custom Java component built using OSU Components conventions
- Efficient storage and retrieval of champion data
- Well-defined abstraction function and representation invariant
- Fully test-cased using systematic unit tests
- Designed for correctness, readability, and maintainability

## Design Principles

This project follows the OSU Components methodology, including:
- Strict separation of interface and implementation
- Use of mathematical models to define component behavior
- Explicit representation invariants
- Clear abstraction functions
- Defensive programming to preserve component correctness

## Implementation Details

- Language: Java
- Built using the OSU Components Library
- Internal data structures chosen to support efficient lookup and updates
- All public methods adhere to documented preconditions and postconditions

## Testing

The component is thoroughly tested to ensure correctness and stability:
- Unit tests cover typical use cases and edge cases
- Tests validate representation invariants
- All public methods are exercised through test cases

## Example Use Case

This component can be used to:
- Store structured data about League of Legends champions
- Query champion attributes efficiently
- Serve as a foundation for larger applications or simulations

## What I Learned

- Designing reusable software components using formal specifications
- Applying data structure concepts to real-world modeling problems
- Writing testable, maintainable Java code
- Following large-scale library design constraints and guidelines
